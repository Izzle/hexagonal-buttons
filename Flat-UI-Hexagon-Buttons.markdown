Flat UI Hexagon Buttons
-----------------------
Flat UI design hexagon buttons.  Made with Sass for a custom color mixin.  I tried to keep the design of the individual hexagons as simple as possible so they are lightweight and had maximum browsers support (then I got carried away with design).  Feel free to export to CSS3.

Note: the animation is a work in progress.  I'm not sure what I want to do with them yet.

The colors used are from designmodo. //Thanks guys!
